# redditmark

![build](https://github.com/dvejmz/redditmark/workflows/master/badge.svg)

Simple, single-purpose, single-page React app to retrieve your list of saved items on reddit.

Note that the app is not able to fully authenticate with the reddit API by itself and therefore must work with a peer auth application to do this on its behalf. See `./packages/auth` for the redditmark implementation.
